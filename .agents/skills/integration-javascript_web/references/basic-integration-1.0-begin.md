title: Amplitude Setup - Begin
description: Start the event tracking setup process by analyzing the project and creating an event tracking plan
---

We're making an event tracking plan for this project.

Before proceeding, find any existing `amplitude.track()` code. Make note of event name formatting.

From the project's file list, select between 10 and 15 files that might have interesting business value for event tracking, especially conversion and churn events. Also look for additional files related to login that could be used for identifying users. Read the files. If a file is already well-covered by Amplitude events, replace it with another option. Do not spawn subagents.

Look for opportunities to track client-side events.

**IMPORTANT: Server-side events are REQUIRED** if the project includes any instrumentable server-side code. If the project has API routes (e.g., `app/api/**/route.ts`) or Server Actions, you MUST include server-side events for critical business operations like:

  - Payment/checkout completion
  - Webhook handlers
  - Authentication endpoints

Do not skip server-side events - they capture actions that cannot be tracked client-side.

After drafting the event list, persist it through the wizard-tools **`confirm_event_plan`** tool so it is written to the canonical path **`<projectRoot>/.amplitude/events.json`**. Each entry should include event name, event description, and the file path where the event will be placed. If events already exist, don't duplicate them; supplement them. Do **not** create a root-level `.amplitude-events.json` file — current Amplitude Wizard builds only read the plan from `.amplitude/events.json`.

**Event names MUST use Title Case with spaces** following the [Noun] + [Past-Tense Verb] pattern (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Sign Up Completed", "Cart Viewed"). Do NOT use snake_case (button_clicked), camelCase (buttonClicked), or SCREAMING_SNAKE (BUTTON_CLICKED). Property names should use snake_case (e.g., button_text, page_url).

Track actions only, not pageviews. These can be captured automatically via Amplitude's autocapture. Exceptions can be made for "viewed"-type events that correspond to the top of a conversion funnel.

As you review files, make an internal note of opportunities to identify users. We'll need them for the next step.

## Status

Before beginning a phase of the setup, you will send a status message with the exact prefix '[STATUS]', as in:

[STATUS] Checking project structure.

Status to report in this phase:

- Checking project structure
- Verifying Amplitude dependencies
- Generating events based on project
